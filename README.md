## Welcome 
Thank you! for choosing to attend this session "GenAI Essentials: Executing Simple LLM Inference on CPUs and Tailoring LLM Models for Custom Chatbot"
This github repository holds the necessary artifacts for participating in the handson AI workshop.
## Objective
1. Get the hands-on experience on the new IntelÂ® Developer Cloud.
2. Explore the optimizations delivered through the Intel Extension for Pytorch and IPEX-LLM.
3. Participants will gain a foundational understanding of Generative AI and its applications.
4. Participants will be able to perform simple LLM inference on a CPU and understand the process of fine-tuning LLMs for custom applications.
5. Create a 5-page report on Problem, Technical approach and results.
## Pre-requisites
1. Understanding of Machine Learning Concepts
2. Programming skills (Python, NLP libraries like Hugging Face, transformers)
3. Experience with natural language processing (NLP) and text-based AI models (e.g., language models, chatbots)
